	Our game follows the unnamed protagonist, the snail, and his glorious quest to deliver his mail.
His snail mail to be precise. The player is prompted by a pop-up dialogue box to find and deliver the mail which
gives narrative. The player, while exploring, may find themselves unable to cross the bridge which requires a 
key found in another part of the world in a cave maze. This simple task of delivering mail is quickly turned more difficult 
in the presence of enemy beetles, exploring the world for answers, and solving the maze. Many of our aesthetics came from 
the opengameart website which we tried our best to fit into the somewhat pixelated visuals of our game. We used vibrant
colors and relaxing music, which is nice for the player but is also somewhat misleading since, although the game is
simple, even after plenty of practice dodging some of those beetles can be hard. We used colliders and triggers to keep the
player contained and the actions between enemies and quest items between the player possible. The enemies move around
using the ping pong system and the player has basic keyboard input for movement. The game has booleans for
when the player picks up the key or mail, which will allow them to certain areas or to beat the game. 
	Working with tilemaps was difficult at first, as I would often make one go over the other, then vice versa which
made flavor difficult until I finished the video and realized the z positions mattered for that respect. Getting the player
to move was fun and watching the world come together overtime was very enjoyable as it got more immersive and aesthetically
pleasing. 
	I learned just how different the roles of game designer and game programmer are while working on this project. As the game grew in complexity, I realized that the core 
mechanics were all in place, and I could make simple changes to design the game outside of code. This was particularly helpful when I could just copy and paste the creepy crawly beetles and change their paths very easily using a list of locations. The tileset was also a joy to play with and make a world inhabited by the beetles and snail. Managing the two scenes was the biggest headache in this project, and I think I will need to work on it more in future projects.
